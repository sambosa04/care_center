A Flutter and Firebase mobile application for managing equipment rentals and donations in a care center. The system allows renters to reserve equipment, track rentals, receive reminders and overdue notifications, and submit donations. Guests can donate equipment, while administrators manage inventory, reservations, maintenance, donations, reports, and notifications.
The application supports role-based access, real-time updates, automated availability tracking, smart rental duration suggestions, and detailed reporting using Firebase Firestore.
